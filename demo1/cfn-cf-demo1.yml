  Launch a static website backed by an S3 bucket and served via https through cloudfront.
  Assumes you have the following available already:
  * An address in mind (e.g. blog.example.com)
  * An existing Route53 Hosted Zone for the domain
  * A HTTPS certificate registered in ACM in the us-east-1 region
